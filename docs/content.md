### Notes from our clients:
1. I've used local private chefs before, but Kept is the first company that really exceeded all expectations.
2. With three kids and no time to cook, their kid food add-ons brought sooo much order, joy, and actual peace back to our evenings.
3. I used to dread meal planning, now I come home to food I actually can't wait to eat. It's so much less stressful to only have to plan my own breakfast now.
4. Honestly this has been the most high-value service I've ever invested in. I can't even tell you how much easier it's made my life.
5. Honestly all the food I've tried is just amazing. Having a private chef sounds like a luxury, but when you compare this to how much money I'd otherwise have spent eating out and ordering Uber Eats, it's honestly cheaper and actually nutritious.
6. I work long hours and value my privacy â€“ my chef really understands how to get the job done without disrupting my routine.

### Structure, Simplicity, and Seriously Good Food

### The Details That Define Us

**Expertly matched, thoroughly vetted.**  
Every Kept chef is hand-selected for their culinary skill, professionalism, and presence in the home. We work only with seasoned chefs, compensate them well, and create an environment where theyâ€™re genuinely invested in the families they serve.

**Menus designed with care, built around you.**  
Each week, your chef creates a menu tailored to your preferences, health goals, and evolving feedback. We prioritize organic seasonal ingredients and nutrient-dense selections â€“ sourcing from trusted local vendors whenever possible, and always with your householdâ€™s wellbeing in mind. The result is food that feels personal, aligned, and deeply satisfying.

**A service shaped around real households.**  
We serve high-performing homes of all kinds, from working parents to households with complex schedules. Whether itâ€™s meals your kids will actually eat, lunch ready to take with you, or dinner handled after a packed day, we tailor every detail to fit your rhythm.

**We handle everything, so you donâ€™t have to.**  
From planning and shopping to cooking, packaging, and cleanup, your chef manages the full process. Meals are neatly prepared and stocked in your fridge, ready when you are. No coordination, no stress, no work on your part.

**We replace food stress with consistent, nourishing meals, so home life feels easier, and you can show up where it matters.**

**Our team is led by founders with extensive backgrounds in nutrition consulting and culinary operations.**  
That foundation shapes everything we do â€“ from how we hire and train chefs to how we design meals and support long-term wellbeing. The result is food thatâ€™s both deeply satisfying and designed to support long-term wellbeing.

# FAQ Page

### What if I need to reschedule my cook date same-week or just skip a week?

We understand that travel, illness, or unexpected scheduling conflicts can come up. Our goal is to be as accommodating as possible, while still preserving the consistency our chefs rely on.

**Rescheduling Within the Same Week**  
If you need to move your cook day within the same week, we require at least 48 hoursâ€™ notice. Weâ€™ll do our best to reschedule based on chef availability.

**Skipping a Full Week**  
If you need to skip a full week of service, please notify us by Thursday at 10:00pm for the following week.

- **Week-to-week clients**: Skipped weeks will not be billed, and service will resume the following week.  
- **6-month agreements**: Clients may skip up to 3 weeks per term.  
- **12-month agreements**: Clients may skip up to 6 weeks per term.  

Skipped weeks do not extend your contract term.

If a chef purchases groceries on your service day and you cancel, you will be billed for both the grocery cost and that weekâ€™s service fee.  

We reserve ongoing chef availability for clients with consistent weekly service. Frequent skips may result in a loss of your reserved chef time or adjustments to your service schedule.
