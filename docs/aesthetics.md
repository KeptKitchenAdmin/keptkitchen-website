# Kept Kitchen Co. – Brand + Aesthetic Brief

---

## 1. Brand Personality

Kept Kitchen Co. is elegant but grounded — where culinary care meets restorative luxury. This isn’t a showy, performative brand — it’s built for high-functioning, privacy-valuing individuals and families who expect excellence without excess.

- **Tone**: Warmly authoritative, confident, curated, never salesy.
- **Voice**: Direct but refined. Think Aesop meets RH meets fine hospitality — no fluff, no hyperbole. Let the visuals and precision do the talking.
- **Audience**: Executives, dual-career families, athletes, new parents, and elevated-but-busy households in Portland/Vancouver who want nourishing, gorgeous food with no friction.

## 2. Design Language & Mood

Kept Kitchen Co. embodies lived-in elegance and a cinematic calm. Your board is filled with low-lit textures, wood tones, matte finishes, and slow food aesthetics. The feeling is immersive and multi-sensory — food isn’t just sustenance, it’s sensual, grounding, and almost nostalgic.

**✦ Core Aesthetic Themes:**

- **Editorial realism**: Natural light, visible hands, steam rising from pots, imperfect wooden boards, tactile surfaces.
- **Cinematic intimacy**: Moody tones, focus pulls, deep shadows. The feel of a luxury magazine or European villa kitchen.
- **Luxury meets nourishment**: Jet travel, Porsches, leather, Restoration Hardware interiors — but paired with fig salads and bone broth.
- **Masculine-feminine balance**: Textured wood, raw linen, brown leather and black marble — offset by florals, velvet, and herbs.

## 3. Color Palette (do not change this)

Keep the current site’s soft, grounding color scheme. It complements your photos and tone:

| Element       | Tone Example                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Backgrounds   | Ivory, bone, soft sand (#f4efe8)  |
| Text          | Espresso or charcoal (#2e2a27)    |
| Accents       | Warm taupe, clay, muted gold      |
| Buttons/CTAs  | Deep brown/black, serif all-caps  |

The site must feel like matte paper and candlelight, not LED screens.

## 4. Font & Typography Direction

- **Main font**: High-end serif (like Canela, Garamond, or Cormorant Garamond)
- **Body font**: Soft, breathable sans-serif (like DM Sans or Inter)
- **Avoid**: Tight spacing or small font sizes — this is for relaxed luxury browsing.

**Tone note**:  
Use all-caps serif for CTAs (e.g., SUBMIT, SEND), sentence case for paragraph headers, and never yell in all caps unless intentional.

## 5. Imagery Guidance

Images should feel like they came from:

- A slow-cooked Italian film
- The back kitchen of a Napa villa
- A private jet with ceramic dinnerware
- A field-to-table chef’s journal

**Use imagery that:**

- Celebrates motion (hands chopping, flour dust, wine pouring)
- Incorporates natural textures (linen, wood, stone, leather)
- Mixes food with lifestyle (wine, watches, lake views, vintage kitchens)

**Avoid:**

- Overexposed whites
- Bright primary colors
- AI-looking images
- Anything that feels like influencer content

---

## 6. Page Flow & Experience

The experience should be linear and soothing — no aggressive popups or modals. CTA buttons should be clear, minimal, and deliberate.

**Key sections:**

- **Homepage**: Headline over a quiet video loop or hero image. Clear CTA to “Explore Service” or “Request Availability.”
- **About**: Brief, direct. Use paragraph spacing, not long scrolls.
- **Services / FAQ**: Accordion or stacked layout with minimalist icons.
- **Sign-Up Form**: Soft rounded edges, long forms, but easy-to-navigate.
- **Contact**: Intimate, almost like writing a letter. Avoid chatbots.
